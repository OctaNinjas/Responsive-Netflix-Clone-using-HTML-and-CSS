Amazon Clone Project:
This is a simple Amazon homepage clone I made using HTML and CSS.
I made this project to practice building a website layout and using different sections like navbar, products, and footer.

What I Did:
Created a navigation bar with logo, search bar, location, flag, account, and cart icons.
Made a panel section with menu and quick links like "Todayâ€™s Deals" and "Customer Service".
Added a hero section with a big background image.
Created multiple product boxes like Clothes, Electronics, Health, Beauty, Pet Care, etc.
Designed a footer with multiple columns and Amazon logo.
Used Font Awesome icons for cart, search, flag, and location.

Tech Used:
HTML
CSS
Font Awesome

Note
This is a practice project for learning purposes and is not affiliated with Amazon.
